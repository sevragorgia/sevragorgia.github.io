I am not a matematician. I have, however, to teach my students about some important teorems in our statistics course. One of this teorems is the [Central Limit Teorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem).

I ussually do this using an animation I created using the R package 'animation'.
