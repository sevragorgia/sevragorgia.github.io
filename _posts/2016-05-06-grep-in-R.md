I just keep finding cool stuff in **R**. I hope you know about *grep* in uninx. If not google it, is a wonderful tool to find a pattern in the contents of a file.

I just looked around for like 5 second and found that **R** also has a method called *grep*; it actually has many derivative of *grep*. You can use this method to match a pattern on a string of text and get the row index matching the pattern. Cool!

I will try a bit more and will post some code using this in a while...
